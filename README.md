# 3D-Scene-and-Design-Decisions
My 3D scene was too big so I could not add it to the files.

How do I approach designing software?  
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?  
What design process did you follow for your project work?  
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?  

One of the significant design skills I was able to craft was making a program in stages. Over the course of these past few weeks, I really like working on the project in stages and focusing on one part of the project at a time. I think this was a good process and helped me stay focused on each task and made the project a lot easier to manage than if I did it all at once. I think this is a good model that could be used in future work projects to help a project be more manageable.

How do I approach developing programs?  
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?  
How did iteration factor into your development?  
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

When developing a program a have tried to keep them organized and logical as best I can to make sure the program is easy to understand. This was the main strategy I used when developing my program.  If I am being honest I don't think I thought much about iteration in this project. I try to keep my process mostly the same through each milestone and when I ran into trouble I just tried to remain calm and keep trying different things until I figured out what was rough.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?  

Computer science will help me reach my goals by helping me get a good job and provide for me and my wife. Since my degree is in computer science computational graphics and visualizations will help me learn how to make more and more complex programs which will help me through both my educational and professional pathways.
